# physical_oceanography
These are homeworks I done in course introduction to physical oceanography. <br>
All of them are written in matlab.

## hw1
In this homework, I get data from database of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).<br>
After that, I use contourf to plot the data, and observer how temperature and salinity change with latitude and longitude.

## hw2
In this homework, I use seawater toolbox to draw a T-S diagram and mark AAIW, NADW, and AABW on it.<br>
Also, I count the in-situ temperature and potential temperature of a specific station, as well as in-situ density. 

## hw3
Assuming the ocean has constant salinity gradients in both y (north-south) and z direction, I compute the density and plot the distribution. <br>
And then, I use thermal wind relation to infer geostrophic flow.

## hw4
Modeling Ekman sprial by ode and Euler method.

## final
1. plot the density distribution and identify upwelling and downwelling regions.<br>
2. use thermal wind relation to infer along-channel geostrophic flow. <br>
3. plot the vertical structure of ageostrophic velocity, and end up a Ekman spiral.
