These are homework I done in course introduction to physical oceanography

## hw1
In this homework, I get data from database of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).<br>
After that, I use contourf to plot the data, and observer how temperature and salinity change with latitude and longitude.

## hw2
In this homework, I use seawater toolbox to draw a T-S diagram and mark AAIW, NADW, and AABW on it.<br>
Also, I count the in-situ temperature and potential temperature of a specific station, as well as in-situ density.
